# Scripts
 
The order and description of the scripts is as follows:

`01_calculate_mean_and_stability.R` - calculates stability using all data or subsets of data.

`02_stability_mapping.R` - run genomewide association analysis for the genotype mean and stability estimates.

`03_stability_mapping_resampling.R` - run genomewide association analysis using the subsets of environments.

`04_stability_mapping_analysis.R` - analysis of mapping results, including identification of overlapping QTL and genes.

`05_stability_prediction.R` - run genomewide prediction for the genotype mean and stability.

`06_figures.R` - create figures.
